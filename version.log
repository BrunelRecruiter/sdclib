Update to version 3.0.0 D10_2017_10_05_rev2:

- State handlers are templated now. Old API state handler classes deleted. 		
- Use e.g. SDCProviderMDStateHandler<NumericMetricState> / SDCConsumerMDStateHandler<NumericMetricState> instead.
- Unified state handlers: No multistate handlers anymore. Multistates are also handled by SDCConsumerEventHandler. Use one handler per state and / or define a state handler for the descriptor that comprises all the multiple context state


Update to version 2.1.0 D10_2017_10_05_rev2:

- updated to new participant model (data model), standard version: Draft 10 Revision 2
- implemented code generator for data model XSD wrapper classes
- API adapted: 
	- MDIB classes have no (publicly accessable) default constructor, user has to pass mandatory MDIB fields to the constructor (security feature)
	- findState(), requestState() adapted (returing smart pointers instead of using referenced object)
	
Update to version 2.0.1:

- OSCPProvider expanded: able to load MDDescription from xml file
- Selectable number of attempts to open a socket if port is blocked in OSCLibrary 
- Bugfixes


Upgrade to version 2.0.0:

- new architecture for higher stability and security
- new API: finalized (not derivable) API-classes (see ExampleProject.cpp for an implementation example of a service provider, service consumer and state handlers)
- incompatible to former versions of OSClib 1.X.X
