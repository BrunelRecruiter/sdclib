## Advanced Examples
Advanced Examples (SDC_ADVANCED_EXAMPLES) need asio.  
Navigate to the cloned sdclib folder and execute:

## Linux
We recommend building / using the SDCLib under a Debian or Debian-based distribution (f.e. Ubuntu and flavors). The required dependencies can easily
be installed from the packet repositories.

## Windows
Building the SDCLib under Windows requires some extra steps. You have to setup the dependencies before generating the CMake project.
The provided documentation is divided in setting up the dependencies and generating and importing the CMake project into Visual Studio.

## Raspberry PI - Raspbian
To build the SDCLib under Raspbian follow the Linux instructions.

## Doxygen
See the Doxygen folder to generate a Doxygen documentation.
